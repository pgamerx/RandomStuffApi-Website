                Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do
                not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and
                You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal
                Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have
                collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without
                verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
                information from Our servers.

                Your information and Your country requires consent from a
                parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect
                and use that information.
